# imgurcrawler

An image crawler that collects random images from Imgur.

This script generates a fixed string of 7 characters composed of `A-Za-z0-9`
and tries to download an Imgur image whose ID is equal to that string. If it
finds something, it downloads to the *build/images* folder.

Since this process is "CPU bound", the script can also send a OS-notification
whenever it finds an image. It also detects if the downloaded image is
a *.gif*, a *.png* or a *.jpg*, renaming the file accordingly.


## Usage

Run the following in your command prompt:

```shell
go get -u github.com/enzo-santos/imgurcrawler
```

Import it into your code as

```go
import (
	"github.com/enzo-santos/imgurcrawler"
)
```

This package imports a single function named `DownloadUrl`. Its single
parameter is an Imgur ID. The function will try to download the image stored
with the given ID. If there is no image, it returns *false*. Otherwise, it
downloads the image with the appropriate extension to *build/images* in the
current directory and returns *true*.  


## Command-line usage

To access the executable of this package, run the following:

```shell
go install github.com/enzo-santos/imgurcrawler/cmd/imgurcrawler@latest
```

It'll download it to the *bin* folder of the path shown by `go env GOPATH`.

The basic usage is

```shell
imgurcrawler
```

It tries to find random Imgur images *ad infinitum*.


### Creational flags

All creational flags can be used with each other.

```shell
imgurcrawler -i "FQHZlGg" -i "olTru93"
```

It tries to find Imgur images for each `-i` argument given. Can be used one or
more times.

```shell
imgurcrawler -f args.txt
```

It tries to find Imgur images for each line of the `-f` argument given, as a
file. Can be used one or more times.


### Behavioral flags

```shell
imgurcrawler --no-notify
```

If it finds any Imgur image, it'll not display the OS-notification.

```shell
imgurcrawler --no-stdout
```

It'll not print anything to the standard output (*stdout*).

```shell
imgurcrawler --delay 2
```

It waits for the given amount of seconds before trying to find another Imgur
image.
